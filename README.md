# PWAFinalProject

At this stage of the course, each student is asked to develop a web application as a proof of concept in which they will implement the various features covered in the full-stack development (front-end and back-end) based on the JavaScript language that has been applied throughout the semester. 

The project proposal is an individual one, the topic of which should derive from your professional experience or practices, seeking to contribute to the resolution of a specific case.   

The development of the technical project involves the methodological presentation of the implementation of a web application, using prototyping tools, web programming environments (Visual Studio Code) and version control (Git).
